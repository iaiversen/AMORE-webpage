Active Monitoring of Oxytocin Research Evidence
:::

AMORE hosts living meta-analyses for biobehavioral oxytocin research, serving as a centralized platform that aggregates articles and materials on dedicated project pages for each meta-analysis.

Designed to advance oxytocin biobehavioral research, a standardized framework ensures that all living meta-analyses featured on AMORE maintain timely integration of emerging evidence with rigorous methodology and transparency throughout the research process.
