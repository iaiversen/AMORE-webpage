## What is the AMORE initiative about?

The Active Monitoring of Oxytocin Research Evidence (AMORE) platform serves as a living meta-analysis hub for oxytocin research related to biobehavioral outcomes. Living meta analysis is a tool to better understand findings of individual studies and place them in a bigger evidence picture. Whereas traditional meta-analysis becomes outdated, living meta analysis are regularly updated. Retracted papers can be removed and newly published papers can be included in the analysis. This ensures that the newest evidence is reflected in the living meta-analysis.

### Aims of AMORE

1
:::
#### Real-time insights 
Researchers get access to the most current understanding of oxytocin research findings. Unlike traditional meta-analyses that become outdated, our platform continuously incorporates new research findings.

:::
#### Quality Control
The expert steering committe oversees the projects ensuring platform standards. Retracted papers are promptly removed, ensuring only reliable evidence informs our conclusions.

:::
#### Transparent Science 
Living meta-analysis published on AMORE commit to transparency through pre-registration, pre-prints, open data, deviation reports, and publicly available analysis scripts. Transparent research foster collaboration and repoducibility efforts.

## Expert Steering Committee 

The AMORE platform is overseen by a steering committee of experts in the oxytocin research field. The committee:

- Approves project proposals
- Provides methodological guidance
- Ensures computational reproducibility
- Maintains platform standards
