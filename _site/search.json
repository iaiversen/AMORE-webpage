    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis living meta-analysis investigates the relationship between perinatal exposure to exogenous oxytocin and the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism in children. Oxytocin is commonly used to induce and augment labor, with up to 50% of births in developed countries and varying rates (0.7% to 97.0%) in low- and lower-middle-income countries associated with synthetic oxytocin use.\nThe analysis employs a frequentist approach, utilizing random effects models with the Paule-Mandel estimator to synthesize findings across the literature. The project addresses whether perinatal exposure to exogenous oxytocin increases the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions in children. This living meta-analysis will be updated every 24 months, ensuring the incorporation of emerging evidence."

Studies will be independently rated by two reviewers within three categories: selection, comparability, and exposure/outcome, with scores categorized as low (0–3), moderate (4–7), or high (8–11) quality.\nStatistical analyses will be conducted using R statistical software with the metafor, meta, and RoBMA packages. Random effects models will be used with the Paule-Mandel estimator for τ². Heterogeneity will be evaluated by calculating I² and τ². Publication bias will be assessed using Robust Bayesian Meta-Analysis (RoBMA) and by constructing contour-enhanced funnel plot visualization and performing Egger’s regression test."

AMORE serves as a central hub connecting documentation stored in recognized external repositories with their respective meta-analysis, making research easily accessible.\nLiving meta-analysis published on AMORE must adhere to our standardization framework, which includes both mandatory requirements and recommended practices. A key requirement is that all analyses must be updated at least every 24 months to reflect current evidence in the field.\n\nPublish your Living Meta Analysis\n\n\n\nAims of AMORE\n\n\n\nAMORE aims to facilitate living meta analysis in the oxytocin research field through standardized practices.\n\n\n\nLiving meta-analysis is a regularly updated evidence synthesis that reflects the current state of research. AMORE aims too ensure that the evidence remains current, preventing meta-analyses from becoming outdated.\n\n\n\nLiving meta-analysis published on AMORE commit to transparency through pre-registration, open data, and publicly available analysis scripts."
