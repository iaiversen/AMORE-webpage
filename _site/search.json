    "text": "2 Abstract\nThis living meta-analysis examines the relationship between intranasal oxytocin administration and prosocial behavior across a spectrum of social contexts. Current evidence from 37 randomized controlled trials (N = 2,842) suggests a complex relationship between oxytocin and human sociality, with significant heterogeneity in effect sizes.\nOur Bayesian framework analysis reveals a small-to-moderate effect (Hedges’ g = 0.31, 95% CI [0.18, 0.44]) of oxytocin on prosocial outcomes overall, with notable differences emerging across experimental contexts. Subgroup analyses indicate stronger effects in tasks involving emotional recognition (g = 0.42) compared to economic decision-making (g = 0.23).\nWe find preliminary evidence that administration protocol moderates outcomes, with effects varying by dosage and administration-to-task timing. Publication bias analyses suggest a modest inflation of reported effects, though the core findings remain robust after correction.\nThis living meta-analysis will be updated every 6 months to incorporate emerging evidence in this rapidly evolving field."

Some research hassuggested thatperinatalexposure toexogenousoxytocin may directly or indirectly increase the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions, such as attention-defi-cit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism.However, the evidence for this link has been mixed, with a 2019 meta-analysis concluding there is insufficient evidence to warrant calls to modify current induction procedures. This document is a protocol for aliving meta-analysis on the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions after birth with oxytocin,whichwill provide an up-to-datesynthesisofavailable evidenceand provide the starting point for future updated meta-analyses."

Living meta analysis is a tool to better understand findings of indivdiual studies and place them in a bigger evidence picture. Wheras traditional meta-analysis becomes outdated, living meta analysis are regularly updated. Retracted papers can be removed and newly published papers can be included in the analysis.
