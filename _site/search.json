Preliminary evidence from 28 studies (N = 2,143) suggests that individuals with high screen time (&gt;6 hours/day) show significantly lower baseline oxytocin levels compared to moderate users. ## Current Results Latest Bayesian analysis (k = 28) shows: - Strong evidence for decreased oxytocin levels (BF₁₀ = 15.2) - Posterior median effect size: -0.45 [95% CI: -0.62, -0.28] - Robustness checks support main conclusions (BF₁₀ &gt; 10 across prior specifications)  ## Subgroup Analyses - Age groups (adolescents show strongest effects) - Device type (social media use vs. passive consumption) - Time of day effects ## Updates Log - 2024-02-15: Added 5 new studies, updated Bayesian models - 2024-01-15: Initial pre-registration and protocol ## Next Update Scheduled for: May 2024 (3-month update cycle) Contact: tech.oxy.study@fakeemail.edu"

Current evidence suggests a complex relationship between oxytocin and physical touch-seeking behavior, with mixed results across 42 studies (N = 3,876). ## Current Results Our latest analysis (k = 42) indicates a small-to-moderate effect of intranasal oxytocin on hugging behavior (Hedges’ g = 0.34, 95% CI [0.21, 0.47], p &lt; .001). Significant moderators include: - Administration timing (β = 0.28, p = .015) - Social context (β = 0.42, p &lt; .001) - Previous relationship status (β = 0.31, p = .008)  ## Updates Log - 2024-02-20: Added 3 new studies, updated effect size calculations - 2023-12-15: Initial analysis with 39 studies - 2023-09-15: Pre-registration completed ## Next Update Scheduled for: August 2025 (18-month update cycle) Contact: fake.email@university.edu"

Living meta analysis is a tool to better understand findings of indivdiual studies and place them in a bigger evidence picture. Wheras traditional meta-analysis becomes outdated, living meta analysis are regularly updated. Retracted papers can be removed and newly published papers can be included in the analysis. This ensures that the newest evidence is reflected in the living meta-analysis.\n\n\nExpert Steering Committee\nThe AMORE platform is overseen by a steering committee of experts in the oxytocin research field.

Current evidence from 37 randomized controlled trials (N = 2,842) suggests a complex relationship between oxytocin and human sociality, with significant heterogeneity in effect sizes.\nOur Bayesian framework analysis reveals a small-to-moderate effect (Hedges’ g = 0.31, 95% CI [0.18, 0.44]) of oxytocin on prosocial outcomes overall, with notable differences emerging across experimental contexts. Subgroup analyses indicate stronger effects in tasks involving emotional recognition (g = 0.42) compared to economic decision-making (g = 0.23).\nWe find preliminary evidence that administration protocol moderates outcomes, with effects varying by dosage and administration-to-task timing. Publication bias analyses suggest a modest inflation of reported effects, though the core findings remain robust after correction.\nThis living meta-analysis will be updated every 6 months to incorporate emerging evidence in this rapidly evolving field."
