    "text": "Abstract\nThis living meta-analysis examines the relationship between intranasal oxytocin administration and prosocial behavior across a spectrum of social contexts. Current evidence from 37 randomized controlled trials (N = 2,842) suggests a complex relationship between oxytocin and human sociality, with significant heterogeneity in effect sizes.\nOur Bayesian framework analysis reveals a small-to-moderate effect (Hedges’ g = 0.31, 95% CI [0.18, 0.44]) of oxytocin on prosocial outcomes overall, with notable differences emerging across experimental contexts. Subgroup analyses indicate stronger effects in tasks involving emotional recognition (g = 0.42) compared to economic decision-making (g = 0.23).\nWe find preliminary evidence that administration protocol moderates outcomes, with effects varying by dosage and administration-to-task timing. Publication bias analyses suggest a modest inflation of reported effects, though the core findings remain robust after correction.\nThis living meta-analysis will be updated every 6 months to incorporate emerging evidence in this rapidly evolving field."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis living meta-analysis investigates the relationship between perinatal exposure to exogenous oxytocin and the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism in children. Oxytocin is commonly used to induce and augment labor, with up to 50% of births in developed countries and varying rates (0.7% to 97.0%) in low- and lower-middle-income countries associated with synthetic oxytocin use.\nThe analysis employs a frequentist approach, utilizing random effects models with the Paule-Mandel estimator to synthesize findings across the literature. The project addresses whether perinatal exposure to exogenous oxytocin increases the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions in children. This living meta-analysis will be updated every 24 months, ensuring the incorporation of emerging evidence."

Studies will be independently rated by two reviewers within three categories: selection, comparability, and exposure/outcome, with scores categorized as low (0–3), moderate (4–7), or high (8–11) quality.\nStatistical analyses will be conducted using R statistical software with the metafor, meta, and RoBMA packages. Random effects models will be used with the Paule-Mandel estimator for τ². Heterogeneity will be evaluated by calculating I² and τ². Publication bias will be assessed using Robust Bayesian Meta-Analysis (RoBMA) and by constructing contour-enhanced funnel plot visualization and performing Egger’s regression test."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis living meta-analysis examines the relationship between intranasal oxytocin administration and prosocial behavior across a spectrum of social contexts. Current evidence from 37 randomized controlled trials (N = 2,842) suggests a complex relationship between oxytocin and human sociality, with significant heterogeneity in effect sizes.\nOur Bayesian framework analysis reveals a small-to-moderate effect (Hedges’ g = 0.31, 95% CI [0.18, 0.44]) of oxytocin on prosocial outcomes overall, with notable differences emerging across experimental contexts. Subgroup analyses indicate stronger effects in tasks involving emotional recognition (g = 0.42) compared to economic decision-making (g = 0.23).\nWe find preliminary evidence that administration protocol moderates outcomes, with effects varying by dosage and administration-to-task timing. Publication bias analyses suggest a modest inflation of reported effects, though the core findings remain robust after correction.\nThis living meta-analysis will be updated every 6 months to incorporate emerging evidence in this rapidly evolving field."
