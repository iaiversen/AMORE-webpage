    "text": "Abstract\nThis living meta-analysis investigates the relationship between perinatal exposure to exogenous oxytocin and the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism in children. Oxytocin is commonly used to induce and augment labor, with up to 50% of births in developed countries and varying rates (0.7% to 97.0%) in low- and lower-middle-income countries associated with synthetic oxytocin use.\nThe analysis employs a frequentist approach, utilizing random effects models with the Paule-Mandel estimator to synthesize findings across the literature. The project addresses whether perinatal exposure to exogenous oxytocin increases the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions in children. This living meta-analysis will be updated every 24 months, ensuring the incorporation of emerging evidence."

In the \"propose your project\" form, you must specify which repository (e.g., Open Science Framework, Zenodo) you will use to store your meta-analysis data.\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Analysis software and repository\n      AMORE's standardized framework requires the use of free software for analyses, and for the analyses scripts to be deposited in a recognised repository. In the \"propose your project\" form, you must specify which free software you will use for your meta-analysis and specify which repository.\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Deviation reporting\n      AMORE's standardized framework require reporting any deviations from the preregistered protocol.

In the \"propose your project\" form, you must indicate whether you plan to address this issue if using a frequentist framework.\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Effect determination with Bayes Factor\n      For Bayesian meta-analyses, AMORE recommends a Bayes factor of 10 to conclude the presence or absence of an effect. In the \"propose your project\" form, please specify the Bayes factor you will use to determine the presence or absence of an effect if you are performing a bayesian meta-analyses.\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Null hypothesis evaluation\n      AMORE recognizes that evaluating evidence for a null hypothesis is critical for falsifying hypotheses. In the \"propose your project\" form, please specify if and how you plan to evaluate evidence for a null hypothesis if performing a frequentist meta-analysis.\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Visualizations\n      Visualization can enhance understanding of meta-analysis results. In the \"propose your project\" form, you may describe which visualizations (e.g., funnel plots, forest plots, others) you plan to include in your meta-analysis."

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality, with disagreements resolved through discussion.\nStatistical analyses were implemented in R Studio 4.2.2 using the metafor package for frequentist meta-analysis and RoBMA for Robust Bayesian Meta-Analysis. A multilevel random-effects model was used to account for multiple dependent outcomes from the same studies. Between-measurement correlation was set at r = 0.3 based on available raw data from one included study."

    "text": "Key Limitations and Future Directions\nStudy Limitations: - Male-dominated samples (consistent with broader oxytocin literature bias) - Generally underpowered individual studies - Heterogeneity in outcome measures across executive function domains - Limited number of studies for some subgroup analyses\nFuture Research Needs: 1. Larger, adequately powered studies 2. Greater inclusion of female participants 3. Standardized outcome measures for executive function assessment 4. Investigation of dose-response relationships 5. Exploration of individual difference moderators\nThe findings suggest that oxytocin’s effects may be more nuanced than previously thought, with specific benefits for cognitive flexibility rather than executive function broadly. This aligns with the allostatic theory of oxytocin, which proposes that oxytocin facilitates adaptive responses to environmental changes."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the effects of oxytocin administration on non-social executive functions in humans. While oxytocin has received considerable attention for its role in social behaviors, emerging evidence suggests broader cognitive effects beyond social contexts.\nThe analysis employed both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, synthesizing 20 effect estimates from 13 eligible studies (729 total participants). The project addresses whether oxytocin administration influences executive functions when measured using non-social stimuli and tasks. A multilevel random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to account for multiple outcomes within studies."

    "text": "Current Results\nThe meta-analysis found no overall significant effect of oxytocin administration on non-social executive functions (Hedges’ g = 0.07, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.22], p = 0.30). However, subgroup analyses revealed significant heterogeneity across different executive function domains.\nKey Findings:\n\nCognitive Flexibility: Significant positive effect (Hedges’ g = 0.20, p = 0.02)\nWorking Memory: No significant effect (Hedges’ g = 0.05)\nInhibitory Control: No significant effect (Hedges’ g = -0.04)\n\nThe Robust Bayesian Meta-Analysis provided moderate support for the absence of an overall effect (BF₁₀ = 0.10) and moderate evidence against publication bias (BF_PB = 0.32). Statistical power analyses indicated that individual studies were generally underpowered (5-10% power) to detect the observed summary effect size.\n\nStatistical Power Analysis\n\n\n\n\nFirepower Plot\n\n\nFigure 2: Firepower plot. Statistical power of the main meta-analysis obtained by calculating the median power for effect sizes ranging from Hedges’ g = 0.1–1 across all studies included in the meta-analysis. The analysis shows that individual studies had very low statistical power (median 6%) to detect the observed summary effect size."
