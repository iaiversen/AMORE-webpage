#### What is the AMORE initiative about? 
The Active Monitoring of Oxytocin Research Evidence (AMORE) platform serves as a living meta-analysis hub for oxytocin research related to biobehavioral outcomes. Living meta analysis is a tool to better understand findings of indivdiual studies and place them in a bigger evidence picture. Wheras traditional meta-analysis becomes outdated, living meta analysis are regularly updated. Retracted papers can be removed and newly published papers can be included in the analysis. This ensures that the newest evidence is reflected in the living meta-analysis.
