## Abstract
This living meta-analysis examines the relationship between intranasal oxytocin administration and prosocial behavior across a spectrum of social contexts. Current evidence from 37 randomized controlled trials (N = 2,842) suggests a complex relationship between oxytocin and human sociality, with significant heterogeneity in effect sizes.

Our Bayesian framework analysis reveals a small-to-moderate effect (Hedges' g = 0.31, 95% CI [0.18, 0.44]) of oxytocin on prosocial outcomes overall, with notable differences emerging across experimental contexts. Subgroup analyses indicate stronger effects in tasks involving emotional recognition (g = 0.42) compared to economic decision-making (g = 0.23).

We find preliminary evidence that administration protocol moderates outcomes, with effects varying by dosage and administration-to-task timing. Publication bias analyses suggest a modest inflation of reported effects, though the core findings remain robust after correction.

This living meta-analysis will be updated every 6 months to incorporate emerging evidence in this rapidly evolving field.
